# ESE382 Digital Design Using VHDL and PLDs - Lab Repository

## Overview

This repository serves as a comprehensive archive of my laboratory work in ESE382 Digital Design Using VHDL and PLDs, offered at Stony Brook University under Prof. Kenneth Short's expert guidance. The course delves into advanced digital design techniques using VHDL for system description, coupled with sophisticated tools for synthesis and implementation on programmable logic devices (PLDs).

## Course Objectives

- Enhance and broaden the understanding of digital system design foundations and advanced concepts.
- Acquire in-depth knowledge and practical experience in VHDL for system modeling, simulation, and verification.
- Implement digital designs on PLDs, learning to navigate and leverage industry-standard software for synthesis and place-and-route processes.

## Lab Overview

The laboratory exercises are designed to translate theoretical knowledge into practical skills, covering the spectrum from VHDL coding to the actual deployment of designs on PLDs. Through these labs, I've honed my abilities to create detailed digital models, simulate their behavior, synthesize the designs, and finally, implement them on hardware.

## Tools and Environment

- **Aldec Active-HDL**: Utilized for writing, testing, and simulating VHDL codes, ensuring the functional correctness of designs before hardware implementation.
- **Synplify Pro**: Employed for synthesizing VHDL code into a gate-level representation, optimizing the design for performance and resource utilization.
- **Lattice Semiconductor Software**: Used for the place-and-route process, mapping the synthesized designs onto PLDs, specifically focusing on optimizing layout to meet timing and resource constraints.

## Repository Structure

- `Labs`: Contains all lab work, including VHDL source files, testbenches, synthesis reports, and place-and-route outcomes.
- `Documentation`: Provides additional resources, guides, and references for the tools and methodologies applied in the labs.
